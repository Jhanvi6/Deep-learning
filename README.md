Multi-label Classification
In this assignment, we solved the multi-label classification task for a dataset with 40,000 images. Each sample in this dataset included:

an image,
one or more labels, notes: up to 19
a short caption that summarizes the image.
Our goal was to implement an image classifier that predicts the labels of image data sample.
